# Test Your Way to a Better Sleep

Ignorance is bliss...or so they say. It used to be that there was no real good
way to unit test our views. Deploying new code involved crossing your fingers,
standing on one foot and sacrificing a lamb in the hopes that nothing would break.

Despite our best efforts things still broke. The world of front-end development is no longer the
wild wild west it used to be where your javascript was written in a monolithic script tag
in the `$(document).ready(function(){...})`.

Fixing bugs was another effort in futility. As you changed the code questions swirled in
your head *What other code is dependent on this?* or *Is this going to break something else?*

With the emergence of React we can now unit test our views. While unit tests are
not fool proof, they do offer early warning signs that something may be broken. 
They also offer baseline functionality when enhancing or re-factoring code.

In this presentation I am going to show you **WHY** and **HOW** you to test your code. 
In the end you'll end up getting a better nights sleep. The lambs will thank you.
